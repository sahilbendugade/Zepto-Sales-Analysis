📊 Zepto Sales Analysis – Data Analytics Project
📌 Overview

This project focuses on analyzing sales data from Zepto to uncover insights related to pricing, discounts, stock availability, and category-wise performance.

📂 Dataset

  Format: CSV
  Data includes:
    Product details
    Category
    MRP & discounted selling price
    Quantity sold
    Discount %
    Stock availability (In Stock / Out of Stock)

🛠 Tools & Technologies
  
  Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib/Seaborn)
  SQL (PostgreSQL / MySQL / SQL Server)
  Power BI
  Jupyter Notebook
  Git & GitHub

🔄 Project Workflow / Steps
1️⃣ Data Loading (Python)
    Imported CSV data using Pandas
    Checked data types, shape, and basic statistics

2️⃣ Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
    Analyzed price distribution, discounts, and quantities
    Category-wise comparison of MRP and sales
    Stock availability analysis

3️⃣ Data Cleaning & Transformation
    Converted MRP from paise to rupees
    Handled missing values and duplicates
    Standardized category names
    Created derived columns (discounted price, availability flag)

4️⃣ SQL Analysis
    Loaded cleaned data into SQL database
    Wrote queries to:
    Find top-selling categories
    Identify out-of-stock products
    Analyze average price and discount by category
    Calculate total and average quantities

5️⃣ Power BI Dashboard
    Built an interactive dashboard including:
    KPI Cards (Avg MRP, Avg Quantity, Total Quantity, Max Discount)
    Category-wise price and quantity analysis
    Stock availability breakdown
    Discounted selling price comparison
    Filters for category, price range, and stock status

📈 Dashboard Highlights
    Clear KPI metrics for quick insights
    Interactive slicers for category, price, and stock
    Visual comparison of discounted sales by category
    Stock availability and inventory distribution

✅ Key Results & Insights
    Certain categories contribute significantly to total sales volume
    High discounts do not always correlate with higher quantity sold
    Multiple fast-moving categories face stock availability issues
    Average MRP varies widely across categories, impacting revenue strategy


🎯 Conclusion

This project demonstrates practical skills in data cleaning, analysis, SQL querying, dashboarding, and business reporting. It reflects a real-world analytics workflow and is suitable for Data Analyst / Business Analyst roles.
